# Note

Currenty this projects is on the earliest stage of development, so don't care about his GUI. Maybe in the future we will change Tkinter to PyQt6, but I'm not sure about it because I like that my old laptop works really fine with Tkinter.

# Tasks

At first we have to add a slider for player, and scrool our music with him. Also it will be nice to add a timeline. Then, we can start to improve GUI.
