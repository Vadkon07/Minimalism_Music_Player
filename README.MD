# Style Music Player

Welcome to the Style Music player, simple but very powerful music player for your computer! You can use him during study, gaming, coding, workout, etc. The main feature of this player is probably his style. It looks like... these legendary apps on computers from "cyber" movies from 90's, do you remember it?

## Features

1. Works on any OS
2. Modern GUI
3. Low system requirements
4. Active development
5. Add-free
6. Cool style (I think it will be nice to listen to Memphis Phonk in this playerahaha) 

## Tasks

1. We have to improve slider which we use to scroll music, because he works not very good.
2. Make it compatible with formats ass wav, ogg, etc.

## About last update

I moved GUI of this app from Tkinter to PyQt6, so for now we have to make it more organised. I think that it will be nice to add button as 'play next' and 'play previous', and of course instead of text inside them set minimalistic images.
