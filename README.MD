# Style Music Player

Welcome to the **Style Music player**, simple but very powerful music player for your computer! You can use him during study, gaming, coding, workout, etc. The main feature of this player is probably his style. It looks like... these legendary apps on computers from "cyber" movies from 90's, do you remember it?

## Features

1. Works on any OS (Windows, Linux, MacOS)
2. Modern GUI
3. Low system requirements
4. Active development
5. Add-free
6. Cool style (I think it will be nice to listen to Memphis Phonk in this player ahaha)
7. Playlist
8. Can play **wav**, **mp3**, **ogg**.

## Tasks

1. We have to improve slider which we use to scroll music, because he works not very good. Like, now you can only set position by one click on a timeline, but you can scrool it (at all it works).

## About last update

I for a little improved slider and also made it compatible with all popular formats of audio.
